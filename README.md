### üíª Project About:

The GPA and CGPA calculator is a sophisticated web application designed to assist students in calculating and tracking their academic performance effortlessly. It offers a dynamic and user-friendly interface built using modern technologies like React, TypeScript, and Next.js. The tool addresses the common challenge of manually calculating GPA and CGPA, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Traditional methods involve complex formulas and various grading scales, leading to inaccuracies and frustration. This manual process requires students to track their grades and credits while applying specific formulas, making it cumbersome and prone to mistakes. With different grading systems across institutions, the process becomes even more challenging.

To tackle these issues, I created a web-based solution that automates these calculations, provides instant results, and accommodates various grading systems. The application allows users to seamlessly input their grades and course credits, automatically computing the GPA and CGPA, thus making academic tracking straightforward and reliable.

The integration of React and Next.js ensures a responsive and high-performance application, while TypeScript adds robustness through type safety. This technology combination enhances user experience and provides a solid foundation for future improvements. The project aims to be a valuable student resource by simplifying a complex process and being readily accessible online.

### üìå Problem:

Manually calculating GPA and CGPA presents significant challenges for students. Traditional methods require tracking multiple grades and credits, applying various formulas, and adjusting for different grading scales, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Given the importance of GPA and CGPA in academic and career prospects, inaccuracies can have serious repercussions.

One major issue is the diversity in grading systems. Different institutions may use various grading scales (letter grades, percentage scores, or point systems), making it difficult to apply a universal formula. Additionally, the manual calculation process can be tedious and requires careful attention, often leading to multiple recalculations for accuracy.

Students managing academic records, especially those handling grades from multiple courses over several semesters, may find it difficult to maintain consistent calculations. This highlights the need for an efficient, user-friendly solution that can handle various grading systems and deliver accurate results quickly. A web-based tool that automates these calculations can significantly reduce student burden and help them maintain accurate academic records.
