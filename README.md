### üíª Project About:

The GPA and CGPA calculator is a sophisticated web application designed to help students effortlessly calculate and monitor their academic performance. Utilizing the latest web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Next.js, the tool offers a dynamic and intuitive user experience. It addresses the common challenge of manually calculating GPA and CGPA, a task that can be both time-consuming and error-prone.

Manual GPA and CGPA calculations often involve complex formulas and various grading scales, which can lead to inaccuracies and frustration. Students are required to track their grades, credits, and apply specific formulas, which can be cumbersome and prone to mistakes. The variability in grading systems among institutions further complicates this process.

To tackle these issues, I developed a web-based solution that automates GPA and CGPA calculations, providing instant results and accommodating multiple grading systems. The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing students to input their grades and credits with ease. It computes GPA and CGPA automatically, streamlining the process and ensuring accuracy.

The use of React and Next.js ensures a responsive, high-performance application, while TypeScript enhances reliability by enforcing type safety. This technological stack not only improves user experience but also provides a robust foundation for future upgrades. The project aims to be a valuable asset for students, offering a straightforward tool for academic performance tracking that is accessible online.

### üìå Problem:

Calculating GPA and CGPA manually presents several challenges for students. Traditional methods involve tracking multiple grades and credits, applying various formulas, and often adjusting for different grading systems across institutions. This process is time-consuming and susceptible to errors, which can significantly impact academic and career outcomes.

A major challenge is the diversity of grading systems used by different educational institutions. Schools and universities may utilize letter grades, percentage scores, or point systems, complicating the application of a uniform calculation formula. The manual calculation process requires meticulous attention to detail and often necessitates multiple recalculations to ensure precision.

Students also struggle with managing their academic records, especially when dealing with grades from multiple courses over several semesters. Constant updates and verifications of calculations can lead to mistakes and inconsistencies. Furthermore, students with limited familiarity with mathematical formulas or who lack strong quantitative skills may find the process particularly challenging.

These difficulties highlight the need for a more efficient and user-friendly solution capable of handling diverse grading systems and delivering accurate results quickly. A web-based tool that automates these calculations can greatly ease the burden on students and help them maintain precise academic records.
